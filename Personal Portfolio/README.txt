About me section:
- Need to figure out how to responsively update my image. If the browser window is adjusted to the proper width,
my picture will enter the skills section

Skills section:
- This section contains another column that can be used for additional skills. Need to figure out how to make background responsive
for smaller devices before adding this or it will spill into the experience section

Work section:
- Need to figure out how to limit width of link area. Currently can click anywhere
to the left or right of the image to open the link... should only be on the image itself

- Dynamically add more space if in mobile mode (will align projects in 1 column so need more height for div)

Contact section:
- Want to add a full section for contact info with:
    - icons to social media profiles
    - a direct message section to send me a message from the site to my email
